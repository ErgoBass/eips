# Ergo Improvement Proposals

Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs) specify and/or describe standards for the Ergo Platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, dApp/contract standards, and other such things.

Please check out existing EIPs, such as [EIP-1](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0001.md), to understand the general expectation of how EIPs are supposed to be formatted.
