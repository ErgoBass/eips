Motivation 
----------

Long-term security of the Ergo protocol, including crypto-economic security, always has high priority. 
 One of the hottest topic in this field is (in)stability of cryptocurrency protocols without the block 
 reward (see e.g. [1] for details). 
 
It was planned during the launch of the Ergo network that after end of emission miners will be rewarded with 
transaction fees and also storage rent. However, it is hard to estimate yet how successfully will storage rent replace
emission. 

Thus it was proposed on the ErgoForum informally (in [2] and [3]) to prolong emission (with preserving total supply) 
via a soft-fork([4]). This EIP is concluding previous discussions and provides details on emission soft-fork 
design and implementation.

Updated Emission Schedule
-------------------------

Starting from block #699,393 (first block of 684th epoch), new emission rules applied on top of rules described in the 
Ergo Whitepaper.

Before end of the current emission (before block 2,080,800):

* if block reward is not less than 15 ERG, send 12 ERG from it to the reemission contract
* otherwise, block reward R is less than 15 ERG, send R - 3 ERG from it to the reemission contract

After end of the current emission (from block 2,080,800):

* pay 3 ERG each block from re-emission contract

General Design
--------------

Emission in Ergo is done via a contract locking funds existing since before genesis block. Changing emission then in
an elegant way is tricky. 

This EIP is proposing to use existing contract in combination with checks done in the core protocol which are mandatory 
only for mining nodes. Non-updated nodes will successfully validate blocks which are valid for the new nodes (both 
checking and not checking new rules) after soft-fork activation.

This EIP offers following procedure for that:

* inject two new tokens into emission contract. First token is a singleton one issued to mark emission box. Second token
is reemission token, it will go to mining reward blocks and amount of reemission tokens in mining rewards box shows how 
many ERG should miner send to re-emission contract when spending the box. Any miner can do injection.

* new kind of contract, Re-emission Contract is paying 3 ERG each block after end of emission

* new consensus-level checks are verifying that a proper amount of re-emission token is going from the emission box to 
a miner rewards box, and also that during spending a box which is not emission box but contains re-emission tokens, 
the tokens are being burnt and the same amount of nanoERG is locked by the reemission contract. 
The checks can be switched off via a soft-fork.

 

Reemission Contract
-------------------

```scala
    // output of the reemission contract
    val reemissionOut = ByIndex(Outputs, IntConstant(0))
    
    // output to pay miner
    val minerOut = ByIndex(Outputs, IntConstant(1))
    
    // miner's output must have script which is time-locking reward for miner's pubkey
    // box height must be the same as block height
    val correctMinerOutput = AND(
      EQ(ExtractScriptBytes(minerOut), expectedMinerOutScriptBytesVal(monetarySettings.minerRewardDelay, MinerPubkey)),
      EQ(Height, boxCreationHeight(minerOut))
    )
    
    // reemission output's height must be the same as block height
    val heightCorrect = EQ(boxCreationHeight(reemissionOut), Height)
    
    // reemission output's height is greater than reemission input
    val heightIncreased = GT(Height, boxCreationHeight(Self))
    
    // check that height is greater than end of emission (>= 2,080,800 for the mainnet)
    val afterEmission = GE(Height, IntConstant(emissionPeriod))
    
    // reemission contract must be preserved
    val sameScriptRule = EQ(ExtractScriptBytes(Self), ExtractScriptBytes(reemissionOut))
    
    // miner's reward
    val coinsToIssue = monetarySettings.oneEpochReduction // 3 ERG
    val correctCoinsIssued = EQ(coinsToIssue, Minus(ExtractAmount(Self), ExtractAmount(reemissionOut)))
    
    val sponsored = AND(
      GT(ExtractAmount(reemissionOut)),
      EQ(SizeOf(Outputs), 1)
    )
    
    AND(
      sameScriptRule,
      heightCorrect,
      OR(
        sponsored,
        AND(
          correctMinerOutput,
          afterEmission,
          heightIncreased,
          correctCoinsIssued
        )
      )
    )
```
