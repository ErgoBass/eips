## Description 
This EIP defines a standard serialization formats and contract metadata for cross-platform
reusable contract templates.

## Background And Motivation

Ergo supports flexible language [ErgoTree](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf) of
guarding propositions which protect UTXO boxes. The propositions are stored in the
blockchain according to ErgoTree serialization format, which is designed for compact
storage and fast script execution and transaction validation.

However, ErgoTree binary format intentionally doesn't include metadata, which may be
necessary for various Ergo applications.

This standard defines extended serialization format of contract templates, which may be
reused across different protocol implementations, applications and tools on many
execution environments.

#### Example Use Cases
 - ErgoTree compilers can generate contract templates with the necessary metadata
 - The template generated by ErgoScala compiler can be used in the environments where Java
 jar library generated by Scala2.12 is not supported (Android, native, web, etc.)
 - Once generated the contract template becomes self-contained and can be stored,
 transfered, parsed, executed etc across platforms, tools and applications.

## Contract Template Serialization Format

Each contract template can be represented using an array of bytes. The content of the
array is the following sequence of data fields. Note, the Field Name is not saved and used
here only for description of the corresponding content.
Binary serialization format is suitable for compact storage and wire transfers.


Field Name     |  Format            | Example                | Description
---------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------
`NameLength`   | `VLQ(UInt)`        | 18                     | Length of `Name` bytes 
`Name`         | `Bytes`            | "rewardOutputScript"   | User readable name (string bytes in UTF-8 encoding)
`DescLength`   | `VLQ(UInt)`        | 20                     | Length of `Description` bytes 
`Description`  | `Bytes`            | "holds mining rewards" | User readable contract description (string bytes in UTF-8 encoding)
`ConstLength`  | `VLQ(UInt)`        | 2                      | Number of items in `Constants` 
`Constants`    | `Const+`           | (*)                    | Constant serialization bytes (see _Constant Serialization_ section of [ErgoTree Spec](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf)
`Template`     | `Expr`             | (**)                   | Contract Template bytes with parameter placeholders (see _Expression Serialization_ section of [ErgoTree Spec](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf)
`ParamCount`   | `VLQ(UInt)`        | 1                      | Number of named template parameters
`Parameters`   | `Parameter+`       | delta: Int             | Typed template parameter (see [Parameter Serialization Format](#parameter-serialization-format) section)

_(*)_

  Constant(720, SInt), 
  Constant(SigmaProp(ProveDlog(ECPoint(79be66, 483ada,...))), SSigmaProp)
)

    ConstantPlaceholder(1,SSigmaProp)))
)
```

## Parameter Serialization Format

Parameters specify additional meta information for the contract template. The number of
parameters can be less then equal the number of segregated constants. This is because some
constant values may not be changed without breaking contract logic and hence they cannot
be used as template parameters.

Field Name     |  Format            | Example             | Description
---------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------
`NameLength`   | `VLQ(UInt)`        | 5                   | Length of `Name` bytes 
`Name`         | `Bytes`            | "delta"             | User readable parameter name (string bytes in UTF-8 encoding)
`DescLength`   | `VLQ(UInt)`        | 14                  | Length of `Description` bytes 
`Description`  | `Bytes`            | "spending delay"    | User readable parameter description (string bytes in UTF-8 encoding)
`Type`         | `Type`             | Int                 | ErgoTree type serialized according to section (see _Type Serialization_ section of [ErgoTree Spec](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf)
`Placeholder`  | `VLQ(UInt)`        | 0                   | Placeholder index in constants sequence 

Note, the `Placeholder` maps the parameters to the constant placeholders in the
`Template`.

## JSON Format

In addition to the binary format, the contract templates can be represented using JSON.
It may serve better for some applications. Below we define a standard JSON representation
of contract templates.

```json
{
  "name": "rewardOutputScript",
  "description": "holds mining rewards",
  "constants": "0204a00b08cd0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798",
  "template": "ea02d192a39a8cc7a70173007301",
  "parameters": [
     { 
       "name": "delta",
       "description": "spending delay",
       "type": "04",
       "placeholder": 0
     }
  ]
}
```

## Conversion to ErgoTree

Contract template `t` can be used to compose ErgoTree bytes as shown in the following
table

Field Name     |  Format            | Data Value             
---------------|--------------------|------------------------
`Header`       | `UByte`            | 0x10                   
`ConstLength`  | `VLQ(UInt)`        | t.ConstLength          
`Constants`    | `Const+`           | t.Constants            
`Template`     | `Expr`             | t.Template             

The template parameters can be used to substitute new values in the `Constants` thus
redefining the default values of the template. 

Note, ErgoTree composition for template doesn't require implementation of the full
ErgoTree serializers. Only Constant Serializer have to be implemented to parse and
serialize `Constants` bytes, replace the necessary constants (using parameter
`placeholder` field) and then serialize the updated array of the constants back to the new
bytes array. This relaxed requirement, will significantly simplify composition of valid
ErgoTrees from templates on the platforms, where full serializer is not available.
In particular, a template can be composed in one environment with full ErgoTree support and
then transfered to another environment and used there for actual ErgoTree composition.

## Notes on Supporting this EIP in ErgoTree Compilers

Compilers producing ErgoTree (such as ErgoScript, ErgoScala or others) can support this
EIP directly buy generating a template packaged as either [JSON](#json-format) or
[bytes](#contract-template-serialization-format).

For example in the case of ErgoScala, the compiler is Scala macros. The programmer can
specify the contract template metadata as annotations (on both contract method and its
parameters) and the macros can access them and use for embedding into the template bytes.

The ErgoScala compiler macros maps the parameters of the Scala method to the segregated
constants, however those constants are mixed with other constants in the contract
body (which are not mapped to template parameters).

By using annotations the ErgoScala macros now can map parameters to constant positions (in
ErgoTree.constants array) and use this mapping both in compilation of ErgoTree and
generation of the template bytes. In particular, when creating ErgoTree bytes, the ErgoScala macros can do
partial constant segregation, i.e. segregate only those constants from the expression tree
which are mapped to the parameters leaving others in the tree. Thus created contract template will also satisfy EIP6
requirements, i.e. the number of constants will be the same as the number of parameters.

Similar algorithm can be used in the other ErgoTree compiler implementations.
