### Background And Motivation

Ergo is a blockchain designed for long-term survivability, resilience to attacks and
security. To achieve those tenets the following parameters of the network should be
optimized:
- Blockchain storage size on full nodes
- Speed of Block Candidate assembly from pooled transactions
- transaction validation speed (txs/sec) 
- minimal network traffic required for a node to stay connected and keep the pace of the
blockchaing grows (obtaining new blocks, broadcasting new candidates)
- Node memory footprint 

One of the opportunities to improve the network is to exploit the immutable nature of many
useful contract templates. 
1) Ergo uses many contracts as part of its core protocol like
`feeProposition`, `rewardOutputScript`, `foundationScript` etc. The contracts are fixed
and are not supposed to be changed. 
2) Many applications have a nature of widely reusable services, on top of which other
applications can be created such as ErgoMix, DEX, etc. Their contracts have a natural
tendency to be immutable as well.
3) Immutability of contracts also plays well with security. Intuitively, it feels very
unsafe to send coins to an unknown contract. On the other hand, it is generally safe to
send coins to the _well-known_ contracts, which have well described properties,
verified by community experts and signed by network developers (or Foundation board
members).

However, despite the actual immutability of many contracts, yet their copies have to be
saved in thousands of transactions and UTXO boxes which they protect. This significantly
increases the blockchain size and UTXO memory footprint. It also have significant
computational overhead due to parsing and cost limit control. 

This Ergo Improvement Proposal standardizes the protocol extension to factor those
well-known scripts out of serializable boxes, transactions, blocks and finally out of the
blockchain storage. It also allows to reduce overhead of transaction validation both in
broadcasted blocks and in new block candidates.

### Contract Format
Each well-known contract should be added to the [repository](#contracts-repositiory) by
providing the fields described in the following table.

Field          |  Format      | Description
---------------|--------------|-------------
Name           | UTF-8 string | User readable name
Code           |

### Transaction Validation

Here we describe an extension to the existing Ergo protocol, which allows accelerated and more secure execution
of well-known scripts. The extension doesn't require changes in the
serialization format. Moreover, simple _transfer transactions_ are processed the same way so
that 1) most existing applications (like exchanges) will not require any changes and 2)
the new protocol doesn't incure additional overhead for simple transfer transactions.

On a high level, the new protocol for transaction creation, signing and validation is
described as a series of steps.
