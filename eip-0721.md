## Abstract

This proposal defines an Media NFT Metadata Standard for Ergo NFT tokens

## Motivation

Tokens on Ergo are currently defined using the EIP-0004 Assets Standard. However, this EIP falls short in many aspects. Other EIPs are are attempting to correct some of the biggest issues. So I will be limiting this EIP to specifically deal with a needed standard way to create and display the Token Description and Traits in R5. 
I have labeled this as eip-721 to standardize it IAW the industry as a whole, which uses the ERC-721 standard. Additionally, as a metadata label, I propose using the 721{} label to encase the full NFT Metadata description including all traits. This will align with Cardano, Solana, Ethereum and others and ensure that we have future interoperability with other chains as bridging becomes available and NFT websites begin to integrate Ergo NFTs into their data.

## Considerations

This is written with the assumption that the most recent version of EIP-0004 has been implemented by the wallets, marketplaces, and other ecosystem dApps. Additionally, I have attempted to write this to include the future use of a Policy/collection ID in the Metadata, which will allow the NFTs to easily be tied together into one policy or collections.

## Specification

the `transaction_metadatum_label` below should be reserved specifically for NFT Metadata. this is to ensure our metadata will be easily read and used by other platforms. a 721{} label is the industry standard.

| transaction_metadatum_label | description  |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| 721                         | NFT Metadata |

### General structure

This is the proposed required structure for NFT Metadata in R5.

```
{
  "721": {
    "<policy_id>": {
      "<asset_name>": {
        "name": <string>,

        "image": <uri | array>,
        "mediaType": image/<mime_sub_type>,

        "description": <string | array>,

        "files": [{
          "name": <string>,
          "mediaType": <mime_type>,
          "src": <uri | array>,
          <other_properties>
        }],

        <other properties>
      }
    },
    "version": <version_id>
  }
}
```

### CDDL

- The **`policy_id`** property is marked as required and the the raw bytes of the **`policy_id`** are used.
- The  **`name`** property is marked as required.
- The **`image`** property is required and must be a valid [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) pointing to a resource with mime type `image/*`.  Note that this resource is used as thumbnail or the actual link if the NFT is an image (ideally <= 1MB). If the string representing the resource location is >64 characters, an array may be used in place of a simple JSON string type, which viewers will automatically concatenate to create a single URI.
- Please note that if distributed storage systems like IPFS or Arweave are used it is required to use a URI containing the respective scheme (e.g., `ipfs://` or `ar://`) and not merely the content identifier (CID) as NFT viewers may not be able to locate the file.
		- Valid identifiers would include:
			- `"https://cardano.org/favicon-32x32.png"`
			- `"ipfs://QmbQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp"`
			- `["ipfs://", "QmbQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp"]`
		- Invalid identifiers would include:
			- `"cardano.org/favicon-32x32.png"`
			- `"QmbQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp"`
			- `["Qm", "bQDvKJeo2NgGcGdnUiUFibTzuKNK5Uij7jzmK8ZccmWp"]`
	-  If an inline base64-encoded image will be used, the data must be prepended with a valid `data:<mime_type>;base64` prefix as specified by the [data URL scheme standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs) to indicate the image is an inline data object
	- See [the OpenSea "IPFS and Arweave URIs" section in their reference guide](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#ipfs-and-arweave-uris) for more helpful information on the topic.

- The **`description`** property is optional.

- The **`mediaType`** and **`files`** properties are optional.<br /> **`mediaType`** is however required inside **`files`**. The **`src`** property inside **`files`** is an URI pointing to a resource of this mime type. If the mime type is `image/*`, **`mediaType`** points to the same image, like the on in the **`image`** property, but in an higher resolution.

- The **`version`** property is also optional. If not specified the version is `1`. It will become mandatory in future versions if needed.

- This structure really just defines the basis. New properties and standards can be defined later on for varies uses cases. That's why there is an "other properties" tag.

- The retrieval of the metadata should be the same for all however.

Optional fields allow to save space in the blockchain. Consequently the minimal structure for a single token is:

#### Version 1

```
{
  "721": {
    "<policy_id>": {
      "<asset_name>": {
        "name": <string>,
        "image": <uri | array>
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Version 2

```
{
  "721": {
    "<policy_id>": {
      "<asset_name>": {
        "name": <string>,
        "image": <uri | array>
      }
    },
    "version": 2
  }
}
```

### Retrieve valid metadata for a specific token

As mentioned above this metadata structure allows to have either one token or multiple tokens with also different policies in a single mint transaction. A third party tool can then fetch the token metadata seamlessly. It doesn't matter if the metadata includes just one token or multiple. The proceedure for the third party is always the same:

1. Find the latest mint transaction with the label 721 in the metadata of the specific token
2. Lookup the 721 key
3. Lookup the Policy Id of the token
4. Lookup the Asset name of the token
5. You end up with the correct metadata for the token

### Update metadata link for a specific token

Using the latest mint transaction with the label 721 as valid metadata for a token allows to update the metadata link of this token. As soon as a new mint transaction is occurring including metadata with the label 721, the metadata link is considered updated and the new metadata should be used. This is only possible if the policy allows to mint or burn the same token again.

## Backward Compatibility

To keep NFT metadata compatible with changes coming up in the future, we use the **`version`** property.
A future version will introduce [schema.org](https://schema.org).
