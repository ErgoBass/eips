## Description 
This EIP defines a standard for cross-platform interaction between an online dApp
and a mobile wallet for creating, signing and sending Ergo transactions.

## Background And Motivation

Mobile wallets, (like [Ergo Andorid Wallet]()) typically
support scanning QR codes of [Payment
Request](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/payment-request?address=9er9hxmVcL8S4bNypCyJHpPEEkAfEd9CLq5gNrHN6s2pYomp55N&amount=0&description=).
After scanning a payment request the wallet can build a new transaction, sign it
using a secret key stored locally on the device and then send to the blockchain.

However, in general, this only can be done for _simple_ transactions like
transferring ERGs and assets between Pay-To-Public-Key addresses or transactions
which only spend boxes from P2PK addresses.

The reason for this is simple. In Ergo's eUTXO model a box can be protected by
an arbitrarily complex contract (aka spending condition) and any spending
transaction should satisfy that condition by adding required context variables,
creating expected number of outputs with specific registers depending on the
contract. There is no way for a universal mobile wallet application to know all
the specific details of all the possible contracts.

On the contrary, every Ergo dApp (think of website) is usually built on top of
specific contracts. Business logic of the dApp includes spending of the boxes
protected by those application-specific contracts.
In other words, any dApp is in full control of creating transactions and thus
can spend its own contracts without above mentioned problems. However, the dApp
cannot sign those transactions, because signing requires knowledge of private keys
which are not stored on the dApp, but instead stored on the mobile wallet.

Thus, interaction between a dApp and a mobile wallet is required such that:
1) the dApp builds a transaction and makes it available for the mobile wallet
2) mobile wallet signs the transaction and submits it to the blockchain or
returns back to the dApp
3) dApp monitors the transaction on the blockchain and upon confirmations
proceeds with its business logic.

One possible implementation of such an interaction scheme is described in
[EIP-0012](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/23). It, however, only
suitable for in-browser wallets, which can interact with dApps via javascript
code injected into a web context.

Luckily, the design of Ergo contracts allows for a simple and universal
implementation suitable for mobile wallets. This EIP describes the interaction
protocol and the [Reference Implementation](#reference-implementation).

In this 3 step process the main question is: 
"How the transaction built in dApp can be transferred to the mobile wallet
application so that it can be signed there?".

## ErgoPay Interaction Protocol

An ErgoPay interaction between Hot Wallet, and dApp is driven by dApp's
user and proceeds as the following:

1) The user enters the necessary information in the dApp's UI and proceeds to a
payment screen.

2) The payment screen shows transaction details and a QR code.

3) User scans the QR code using a Hot Wallet application (see
[EIP-0019](eip-0019.md))

4) The Hot Wallet application parses the QR code data and obtains either
`ErgoPaySigningRequest` or `ErgoPaySigningRequestUrl` data (see [Data Formats](#data-formats) section). In the later case the Hot
Wallet uses the scanned url to download `ErgoPaySigningRequest` from the dApp.

5) When `ErgoPaySigningRequest` is obtained, it is shown as a payment screen on the
Hot Wallet containing the same transaction details as the dApp screen.

6) The user compares the dApp's screen, the Wallet's screen and the
transaction details and confirms the payment by using a "Sign" button. If the Hot
Wallet also supports [EIP-0019](eip-0019.md) and private keys are not available,
then the sign button behaves like a "Cold Sign" button according to EIP-0019. 

7) The wallet application signs the transaction either using local private keys
or using Cold Wallet and EIP-0019 protocol. The result of signing is
`SignedTransaction` data.

8) The Hot Wallet obtains the transaction id and sends it to the dApp using
`ErgoPayTransactionSent` API post message, if successful the wallet then submits
`SignedTransaction` to the blockchain.

9) dApp monitors the transaction by id and proceeds with its business logic upon
receiving enough confirmations. This concludes the ErgoPay protocol.

Additional requirements: 
- many instances of ErgoPay protocol MUST be able to run simultaneously withing
the dApp
- the Hot Wallet MAY implement "one-at-a-time" signing. When the signing
is interrupted for some reason it can be started from the step 3) (i.e. scanning
the QR)
- when dApp receives the transaction id, but the `SignedTransaction` is not
accepted to the blockchain then the dApp SHOULD detect this situation and stop
monitoring that transaction.

## Data Formats

The data formats of this EIP are based on a new data structure and
serialization format called `ReducedTransaction` which is described in
[EIP-0019](eip-0019.md).

Below we describe the data formats specified by this EIP and refer to the
formats defined in EIP-0019.

Depending on the bytes size of `ReducedTransaction` it may not fit into 4K limit
of QR codes. In this case or for whatever reason the dApp may encode the
following data in the QR code on the payment screen.

```
ErgoPaySigningRequestUrl
  - messageType: Byte = 2  // request url
  - url: String
```

When the Hot Wallet application parses the QR code bytes it can use first byte
(the `messageType` field) to learn the message type.
When `ErgoPaySigningRequestUrl` is parsed, the Hot Wallet application should
request dApp and obtain the following data.

```
ErgoPaySigningRequest:
  - messageType: Byte = 1  // request itself
  - transaction: ReducedTransaction
  - description: String
  - replyToUrl: String
```
Once the transaction details obtained, they CAN BE OPTIONALLY shown on the payment
screen of the Hot Wallet application.

After signing is performed and the `SignedTransaction` data is obtained, the Hot
Wallet need to send the following data to the dApp using `replyToUrl` from the
signing request.

```
ErgoPayTransactionId:
  - txId: String
```

After `ErgoPayTransactionId` is sent, only then the dApp can submit the
SignedTransaction to the blockchain. The order is important, otherwise, if
transaction is included into blockchain and dApp notification fails the dApp
will be out of sync with blockchain.

## Benefits for dApps
Ergo Pay provides a fast, easy, and secure way for users to buy goods and
services in a dApp or on a website. When supported, Ergo Pay can substantially
increase checkout conversion rates, user loyalty and purchase frequency, and
reduced checkout time. 

- dApp or website donâ€™t need to handle user's secrets (mnemonic/private keys).
Instead, once the user has signed the transaction to confirm purchase intent,
your app or website receives a transaction id to monitor payment status on the
blockchain.
- dApp's users don't need to worry about security of their private keys as the
mobile wallet guarantees they never leave the mobile device
- ErgoPay EIP is compatible with Cold Wallet EIP, thus users can use Cold Wallet
devices to sign transaction within ErgoPay signing process.
- adding Ergo Pay to product detail pages, the cart, checkout page, in payment
settings, or anywhere else a user can choose ErgoPay as the payment method or
initiate a purchase.
- The payment screen can be presented immediately after the user taps the Ergo
Pay button, without any interim screens or pop-ups except to prompt for
necessary product details, such as size or quantity.
- Ergo Pay is simple and universal. It supports all smart contracts and offers
the flexibility to implement simple to complex dApps.

## Benefits for Mobile Wallets

Any mobile wallet team should consider supporting Ergo Pay in their wallet along
with basic wallet features. Users can participate in Ergo dApps and mobile
wallet team can receive service fees from those transactions.
