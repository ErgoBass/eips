## Motivation 

This standard provides a uniform way to issue Ergo tokens.
A standard interface allows any tokens on Ergo to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Ergo tokens background

Ergo supports custom tokens as first-class citizens.
Namely, a special register (R2) of a box contains (tokenId -> amount) pairs.
A box can contain at most 255 of secondary tokens. However, there are also indirect limits: a box could be no more than 4 kilobytes, and also tokens add the computational cost of the transaction.

A transaction can create out-of-thin-air tokens in its outputs if the token identifier is equal to the identifier of the first input box of the transaction.
As the box identifier is cryptographically unique, there's no chance to have the second token with the same identifier while the hash function being used is collision-resistant.
This rule also means that only one new token per transaction can be created.

Unlike ergs, other tokens can be burnt: the total amount for a token in transaction inputs should be no less than the amount of the outputs.
Storage rent component allows a miner to collect (or burn) all the tokens inside a box if it is expired, and there are not enough Ergs in the box to pay the storage rent fee.

## Ergo tokens standard

Though this is not required by the protocol, we propose the following structure for the box that issues a token:

| Register        | Description                                     | Example                      |Encoded                      |
| --------------- |:-----------------------------------------------:| ----------------------------:|----------------------------:|
| R2              | Token id and amount pair                        | [("7d...09", 100000)]        |                             |
| R4              | Token verbose name (UTF-8 representation)       | "USD"                        | "0e03555344"                |
| R5              | Token description (UTF-8 representation)        | "Nothing backed USD token"   | "0e184e6f7468696e67206261636b65642055534420746f6b656e"  |
| R6              | Number of decimals                              | "2"                          | "0e0132"                         |

Note, that additional registers (R4-R6) are encoded as Coll[Byte] type of ErgoScript and their encoded representation is received as `'\x0e' + intToVlq(byteArray.length) + byteArray` where `byteArray` is UTF-8 representation of the original string.
The example above issues one thousand tokens called "USD" with two decimals each.
The transaction that issues such a token was included in block 98288 and may be found in block [explorer](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/5c131f8ae9fa68dab1bac654aa66d364bc7da12107f337a0c9d3d80d8951ee41))

## Ergo NFT standard

This standard is an extension of [token standard](#ergo-tokens-standard):

| Register        | Description                                     | Example                      |Encoded                      |
| ----------- |:---------------:| ----------------------------:|----------------------------:|
| R7              | Asset type (UTF-8 representation)                       | "0101"        | "0e0430313031"|

Note that the starting "01" in the asset type above is representing that the asset is NFT and the final two characters are standardizing the NFT type e.g., Picture artwork NFT. Also, the remaining R8 and R9 registers can be used by each individual asset type based on its needs.

The standardization of various NFT types can be found below:
| Asset name        | R7                                     | R8                      |R9                      |
| --------------- |:-----------------------------------------------:| ----------------------------:|----------------------------:|
| Picture artwork NFT              | "0101"                        | SHA256 hash of the artwork    | Optional - link to the artwork (UTF-8 representation) |

The above registers (R7-R9) are also encoded as Coll[Byte] type.
