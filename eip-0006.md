### Background And Motivation

Ergo is a blockchain designed for long-term survivability, resilience to attacks and
security. To facilitate these goals the following parameters of the network should be
optimized:
- Blockchain storage size on full nodes
- Speed of Block Candidate assembly from pooled transactions
- transaction validation speed (txs/sec) 
- minimal network traffic required for a node to stay connected and keep the pace of the
blockchain growth (obtaining new blocks, broadcasting new candidates)
- Node memory footprint 

One of the opportunities to improve the network is to exploit the _stable_ nature of many
useful contract templates (Here _stability_ means the new versions of the contracts are
not created very often, if created at all):
1) Ergo uses many contracts as part of its core protocol like
`feeProposition`, `rewardOutputScript`, `foundationScript` etc. The contracts are fixed
and are not supposed to be changed. 
2) Many contracts such as those used in ErgoMix, DEX, Crowd Funding, etc. may become
widely reusable. Many applications may be created on top of them. Such contracts have a
natural tendency to be stable to keep backward compatibility with applications that use
them.
3) Stability of contracts also plays well with security. Intuitively, it feels very
unsafe to send coins to an unknown contract. On the other hand, it is generally safe to
send coins to the _well-known_ contracts, which have well described properties,
verified by community experts and signed by network developers (or Foundation board
members).

However, despite the actual stability of many contracts, in the Ergo Protocol v1 their
copies have to be saved in thousands of transactions and UTXO boxes which they protect.
This significantly increases the blockchain size and UTXO memory footprint. It also have
significant computational overhead due to parsing and cost limit control.

This Ergo Improvement Proposal standardizes the protocol extension to factor those
well-known contracts out of serializable boxes, transactions, blocks and finally out of the
blockchain storage. It also allows to reduce validation time of both new block candidates
and broadcasted blocks.

### Well-known Contract Format
Each _well-known contract_ must be specified and registered as it is described in this section and then
added to the [list in the following section](#well-known-contracts-list).

To specify a new well-known contract one needs:

1) Obtain a the last registered well-known contract from [the list of well-known contracts](#well-known-contracts-list).

1) Obtain `contractId` and the current counter value `C` from the contract registration record.

1) Describe the contract template according to [EIP-0005](eip-0005.md) and obtain its
serialized bytes `contractBytes`.

1) Put `Foundation 2-out-of-6 Signature` and creating the
new WCB with the following parameters
```
{
  value: MinErg, 
  proposition: ${CounterContract},
  R2: { WCBTokenId -> 1 },
  R4: C + 1
  R5: "boxId|contractBytes"
}
```

1) Add new contract to the list of the next section using the following data

Column           | Value            | Description
-----------------|------------------|------------------
`Code`           | C + 1            | New code of the  
`Name`           | "feeProposition" | User readable name UTF-8 encoding
`Code`           | 0x0001           | Contract Code unique in the [repository](#contracts-repository)
`Template`       | Base16"36a58ed5" | Contract Template bytes with parameter placeholders
`Parameters`     | delta: Int       | Typed template parameter, array of (name, Type) pairs

### Well-known Contracts List

Each well-known contract must be added here in a sub-section and described according to
the [well-known contract format](#well-known-contract-format)

#### RewardOutputScript 

```json
{
  "parentHash": "",
  "contractCode": 1,
  "contractTemplate": {
    "name": "RewardOutputScript",
    "description": "holds mining rewards",
    "constants": "0204a00b08cd0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798",
    "template": "ea02d192a39a8cc7a70173007301",
    "parameters": [
       { 
         "name": "delta",
         "description": "spending delay",
         "type": "04",
         "placeholder": 0
       }
    ]
  },
  "pgpSignature": "" 
}
```

### Well-known Counter Boxes

Each well-known contract needs to obtain a sequence number, a simple and compact contract
identifier. This counter can be obtained with the help of [Ergo Counter commands]() of
ErgoTool. The Ergo counters are implemented using [Counter Contract]() template and can be
used for various applications. We create a special counter to enumerate well-known
contracts and store them on the Ergo blockchain.

### Cost Estimation

### Transaction Validation

Here we describe an extension to the existing Ergo protocol, which allows accelerated and more secure execution
of well-known scripts. The extension doesn't require changes in the
serialization format. Moreover, simple _transfer transactions_ are processed the same way so
that 1) most existing applications (like exchanges) will not require any changes and 2)
the new protocol doesn't incure additional overhead for simple transfer transactions.

On a high level, the new protocol for transaction creation, signing and validation is
described as a series of steps. 

1) 

2) 
 
3)
