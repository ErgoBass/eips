Motivation 
----------

Following common standards in crypto space simplifies wallets development and migration from
one to another.

The [BIP-0044](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets
as

```
m / 44' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
```

Registered **coin_type**'s can be found in [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)

Proposal
--------

Take last free number **428** for **coin_type** and follow next scheme

```
m / 44' / 428' / account' / change / address_index

```

So the first default key pair for Ergo will have derivation path

```
m / 44' / 428' / 0' / 0 / 0

```
