## Description 
This EIP defines a standard for cross-platform interaction between an online dApp
and a mobile wallet for creating, signing and sending Ergo transactions.

## Background And Motivation

Mobile wallets, (hereafter _MW_), (like [Ergo Andorid Wallet]()) typically
support scanning QR codes of [Payment
Request](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/payment-request?address=9er9hxmVcL8S4bNypCyJHpPEEkAfEd9CLq5gNrHN6s2pYomp55N&amount=0&description=).
After scanning a payment request the MW can build a new transaction
and then sign it using a secret key stored locally on the device.

However, this only can be done for _simple_ transactions like transferring ERGs
and assets between Pay-To-Public-Key addresses or transactions which only spend
boxes from P2PK addresses. The reason for this is simple. In Ergo's eUTXO model
a box can be protected by an arbitrary complex contract (aka spending
condition) and a spending transaction should satisfy that condition by adding
required context variables, creating expected number of outputs with specific
registers etc. and all this depends on the contract. There is no way for a
mobile wallet application to know all the details of all the possible contracts.

On the contrary, every Ergo dApp is usually built on top of specific contracts.
Business logic of dApp includes spending of the boxes protected by
those application-specific contracts.
Thus any dApp is in full control of creating transactions and thus can spend its
own contracts without problems if only it could sign those transactions, but it
cannot because signing requires knowledge of private keys which are not stored
on the dApp, but instead stored on the mobile wallet.

Thus, interaction between a dApp and a mobile wallet is required such that:
1) the dApp builds a transaction and make it available for the mobile wallet
2) mobile wallet signs the transaction and submits it to the blockchain also
returning txId to the dApp
3) dApp monitors the transaction and upon confirmations proceed with its
business logic.

In this 3 step process the main question is: 
"How the transaction built in dApp can be transferred to the mobile wallet
application so that it can be signed there?".

Luckily, the design of Ergo contracts allows for a simple and universal
implementation with full separation of transaction building from transaction
signing. See [Reference Implementation](#reference-implementation) for details.

## Reference Implementation 

The main idea is to introduce a new data structure and serialization format
called `ReducedTransaction`.

```
ReducedTransaction:
  - unsignedTx: UnsignedErgoLikeTransaction
  - reducedInputs: Seq[ReducedInputData]
```
Thus defined `ReducedTransaction` contains unsigned transaction augmented with
reduced input data for each `UnsignedInput`.

```
ReducedInputData:
  - reductionResult: ReductionResult

ReductionResult:
  - value: SigmaBoolean
  - cost: Long
```

With this new ReducedTransaction data structure the signing process can be split
into two independent steps.

First step is to build unsigned transaction and then reduce it in the current
blockchain context, which has connection to one of the network nodes.

```
val reducedTx: ReducedTransaction = ergoClient.execute { ctx: BlockchainContext =>
  val unsigned = createTransaction(ctx, from, to, amountToSend, assets)
  val prover = ctx.newProverBuilder.build // prover without secrets
  prover.reduce(unsigned, 0)
}
```
Reduced transaction data structure can be serialized to bytes and then passed to
the mobile wallet (see [Implementation in dApp](#implementation-in-dapp) section
for details).
```
val reducedTxBytes = ReducedTransactionSerializer.toBytes(reducedTx)
```

Once received in mobile wallet the bytes of the reduced transaction can be
deserialized back into ReducedTransaction object.
A special `ColdErgoClient` instance can be created to perform signing
operations. `ColdErgoClient` don't have connections to Ergo nodes and explorer,
moreover for better security, cold client can forbig operations if any
device connectivity is turned-on, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, Cellular etc.
Note, using ColdErgoClient is not strictly required and ordinary client can be
used instead, however ColdErgoClient allows this EIP to be used in an
implementation of Cold mobile wallets.

```
val reducedTx = ReducedTransactionSerializer.fromBytes(reducedTxBytes)

val coldClient = new ColdErgoClient(NetworkType.MAINNET)

val signedTx = coldClient.execute { ctx: BlockchainContext =>
  // create prover in the cold context using secrets stored on this device
  val prover = BoxOperations.createProver(ctx,
    new File("storage/E2.json").getPath, "abc")
    .build

  prover.signReduced(reducedTx, 0)
}
```
It is important to note, that signatures for all inputs of a reduced transaction
can be generated directly, without script evaluation (aka script reduction) and
and thus, mobile wallet don't need to construct complex spending contexts.

## Benefits for dApps
Ergo Pay provides a fast, easy, and secure way for users to buy goods and
services in a dApp or on a website. When supported, Ergo Pay can substantially
increase checkout conversion rates, user loyalty and purchase frequency, and
reduced checkout time. 

- dApp of website donâ€™t need to handle user's secrets (mnemonic/private keys).
Instead, once the user has signed the transaction to confirm purchase intent,
your app or website receives a transaction id to monitor payment status on the
blockchain.
- dApp's users don't need to worry about security of their private keys as the
mobile wallet guarantees they never leave the mobile device
- adding Ergo Pay to product detail pages, the cart, checkout page, in payment
settings, or anywhere else a user can choose a payment method or initiate a
purchase.
- The payment sheet can be presented immediately after the user taps the Ergo
Pay button, without any interim screens or pop-ups except to prompt for
necessary product details, such as size or quantity.
- Ergo Pay supports all smart contracts and offers the flexibility to implement
simple to complex dApps.

## Benefits for Mobile Wallets

Any mobile wallet team should consider supporting Ergo Pay in their wallet along
with basic wallet features. Users can participate in Ergo dApps and mobile
wallet team can receive service fees from those transactions.
