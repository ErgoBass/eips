Motivation 
----------

Currently, the Ergo node wallet is able to search for boxes protected by simplest scripts associated with P2PK addresses only.
Another limitation is that the node wallet uses a very simple transaction to recognize whether a coin is indeed belongs to the wallet. 
This makes development of external applications harder, as such development would involve scanning blokchain 
independently by the application, with handling forks, confirmation numbers, and so on.

This Ergo Improvement Proposal is about making wallet able to serve needs of an external application by providing 
a flexible scanning interface and also a possibility for the application to inform the wallet that some coins 
successfully passed scanning are indeed belong to the application.

Then each box tracked by the wallet is associated with an application. Among possible applications, there is a default one  
implemented by the node wallet, we call it the SimplePayments application. Other applications are not implemented in 
the wallet but can use its interfaces for simplified scanning and box tracking.  


Specification: Scanning
-----------------------

A new application sends a request to scan. This request is also about registering the application.

A request to scan is about a predicate (function which returns a boolean value for a box), which can be one of the following:

* CONTAINS(rnum, bytes) returns true if certain register contains given bytes. If *rnum* is missed, R1 will be scanned
* EQUALS(rnum, bytes) returns true if certain register contains only given bytes. If *rnum* is missed, R1 will be scanned
* OFTYPE(rnum, typeId) - if certain register is of certain type
* CONTAINS_ASSET(assetId) - if a box contains asset with a given id
* AND(predicate1, predicate2, ..., predicateN) - if all the children predicates are true
* OR(predicate1, predicate2, ..., predicateN) - if one of the children predicates is true

an example of a predicate: AND(CONTAINS_ASSET("bc01de24311298068c07857d3860625abf3277997e2a2b8ff8ea91dda28d47a5"), 
CONTAINS("02dada811a888cd0dc7a0a41739a3ad9b0f427741fe6ca19700cf1a51200c96bf7"))

The request is to be sent in form of a JSON document. In addition to root predicate the document also provides application name 
(up to 255 UTF-8 characters). For the example above, the document would be the following:

{
    "appName": "Asset tracker",
    "predicate": "and",
    "args":[
        {"predicate": "contains", "bytes": "02dada811a888cd0dc7a0a41739a3ad9b0f427741fe6ca19700cf1a51200c96bf7"},
        {"predicate": "containsAsset", "assetId": "02dada811a888cd0dc7a0a41739a3ad9b0f427741fe6ca19700cf1a51200c96bf7"}
    ]
}

on getting the request via */wallet/registerApplication*, the wallet whether returns error if something wrong with request
or a new application identifier. Application identifier is encoded as 64-bit long signed but always positive integer. 
The SimplePayments application always has id == 1. 

* */wallet/applications* request returns all the registered apps

* */wallet/deregisterApplication* removes an application by given id


The SimplePayments application is associated with the OR(CONTAINS(pk_1), ..., CONTAINS(pk_n)) predicate, where 
pk_1, ..., pk_n are public key bytes related to P2PK addresses of the wallet.     


Specification: Recognizing Boxes Externally
-------------------------------------------

The wallet is collecting boxes according to scanning rules. However, a box which is passing a simple test not 
necessarily belongs to an application. An application then needs to inform the wallet on whether a box is certainly
belongs to it or not. The following two methods are informing the wallet about that, and the both methods have 
"applicationId" and "boxId" as inputs:

* */wallet/makeCertain* - to inform the wallet that a box indeed belongs to an application
* */wallet/stopTracking* - to inform the wallet that a box does not belong to an application and 
                            so should not be tracked anymore
                            
                                                                               
Specification: Listing Boxes
-----------------------------

Once boxes are recognized, an external application can use them. To get all the boxes ever belong to an application 
and also unspent boxes, the following API methods are proposed:

* */wallet/applicationBoxes/{applicationId}*
* */wallet/applicationBoxesUnspent/{applicationId}*
