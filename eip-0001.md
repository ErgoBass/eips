Motivation 
----------

Currently, the Ergo node wallet is able to search for boxes protected by simplest scripts associated with P2PK addresses only.
Another limitation is that the node wallet uses a very simple transaction to recognize whether a coin is indeed belongs to the wallet. 
This makes development of external applications harder, as such development would involve scanning blokchain 
independently by the application, with handling forks, confirmation numbers, and so on.

This Ergo Improvement Proposal is about making wallet able to serve needs of an external application by providing 
a flexible scanning interface and also a possibility for the application to inform the wallet that some coins 
successfully passed scanning are indeed belong to the application.

Then each box tracked by the wallet is associated with an application. Among possible applications, there is a default one  
implemented by the node wallet, we call it the SimplePayments application. Other applications are not implemented in 
the wallet but can use its interfaces for simplified scanning and box tracking.  


Specification: Scanning
-----------------------

A new application sends a request to scan. This request is also about registering the application.

A request to scan is about a predicate (function which returns a boolean value for a box), which can be one of the following:

* CONTAINS(register, bytes) returns true if certain register contains given bytes. If *register* is missed, R1 will be scanned
* EQUALS(register, bytes) returns true if certain register contains only given bytes. If *register* is missed, R1 will be scanned
* OFTYPE(register, typeId) - if certain register is of certain type
* CONTAINS_ASSET(assetId) - if a box contains asset with a given id
* AND(predicate1, predicate2, ..., predicateN) - if all the children predicates are true
* OR(predicate1, predicate2, ..., predicateN) - if one of the children predicates is true

an example of a predicate: AND(CONTAINS_ASSET("bc01de24311298068c07857d3860625abf3277997e2a2b8ff8ea91dda28d47a5"), 
CONTAINS("02dada811a888cd0dc7a0a41739a3ad9b0f427741fe6ca19700cf1a51200c96bf7"))

The request is to be sent in form of a JSON document. In addition to root predicate the document also provides application name 
(UTF-8 characters requiring for up to 255 bytes to be encoded). For the example above, the document would be the following:

{
    "appName": "Asset tracker",
    "trackingRule" : {
        "predicate": "and",
        "args":[
            {"predicate": "contains", "bytes": "02dada811a888cd0dc7a0a41739a3ad9b0f427741fe6ca19700cf1a51200c96bf7"},
            {"predicate": "containsAsset", "assetId": "02dada811a888cd0dc7a0a41739a3ad9b0f427741fe6ca19700cf1a51200c96bf7"}
        ]
    }
}

on getting the request via */wallet/registerApplication*, the wallet whether returns error if something wrong with request
or a new application identifier. Application identifier is encoded as 64-bit long signed but always positive integer. 
The SimplePayments application always has id == 1. 

* */wallet/applications* request returns all the registered apps

* */wallet/deregisterApplication* removes an application by given id


The SimplePayments application is associated with the OR(CONTAINS(pk_1), ..., CONTAINS(pk_n)) predicate, where 
pk_1, ..., pk_n are public key bytes related to P2PK addresses of the wallet.     


Specification: Adding Boxes Externally
--------------------------------------

Sometimes it could be simpler for an external application to figure out that some boxes belongs to it without using the
wallet scanner. For that, */wallet/addBox* method is needed.


Specification: Recognizing Boxes Externally
-------------------------------------------

The wallet is collecting boxes according to scanning rules. However, a box which is passing a simple test not 
necessarily belongs to an application. An application then needs to inform the wallet on whether a box is certainly
belongs to it or not. The following two methods are informing the wallet about that, and the both methods have 
"applicationId" and "boxId" as inputs:

* */wallet/makeCertain/{applicationId}/{boxId}* - to inform the wallet that a box indeed belongs to an application
* */wallet/stopTracking/{applicationId}/{boxId}* - to inform the wallet that a box does not belong to an application and 
                            so should not be tracked anymore
                            
                                                                               
Specification: Reading Boxes
-----------------------------

Once boxes are recognized, an external application can use them. To get all the boxes ever belong to an application 
and also unspent boxes, the following API methods are proposed:

* */wallet/applicationBoxes/{applicationId}*
* */wallet/applicationBoxesUnspent/{applicationId}*                       


Specification: Simple Wallet Application
----------------------------------------

Currently, SimplePayments application is using CONTAINS(pubkeyBytes), and this filter could generate a lot of 
false-positives in the presence of applications sharing the same keys. So we would like to propose to change the filter
to *OR(EQUALS(p2pkPropositionBytes),EQUALS(miningPropositionBytes),EQUALS(feePropositionBytes))*, where 
*p2pPropositionBytes* is bytestring of Pay-to-Public-Key script, *miningPropositionBytes* is for mining proposition, 
*feePropositionBytes* is about fee proposition.

Application Examples
--------------------

Here some example scenarios for applications are presented.

* *Crowdfunding*

The simplest crowdfunding script is provided in Section 2.3 of [ErgoScript Whitepaper](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf).

There are two roles in the script, a user and a project. For a user, scanning pledge boxes of self would be 
just *EQUALS(script)*, where *script* is about bytes of a script from the Whitepaper is which embedding both backer and
project encoded public keys. Then the user can withdraw the pledge box is it is active after the crowdfunding deadline.
However, a user may be willing to know about state of the campaign. Project also needs to collect all the pledge boxes.
For that, the simplest option is to use *CONTAINS(projectPubKey)* filter and then analyze script carefully in the 
application, however if the project is using its key for other purposes than the crowdfunding, then the filter will 
give false-positives. To reduce false positives count, instead of the public key, a larger part of the script which 
contains *projectPubKey* but does not contain *backerPubKey* could be used within *CONTAINS()*.

* *Mixing*

For mixing scripts, see Section 3.3.1 of 
[Advanced ErgoScript Tutorial](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/AdvancedErgoScriptTutorial.pdf). To find her half-mix coin
in the mixing application, Alice can simply watch for her public key. Then she is watching for this box, and once the
box is spent, she figures out outputs of the spending transaction and adds her output manually to the wallet. Bob can 
track for large enough parts of the half-mix script not including Alice's pubkey u. 

* *LETS*

We consider trusted LETS described [in this blogpost](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_04_22-lets/). 

Management contract there is using a singleton token, as well as an exchange contract. Thus for both the managers
and a user, needed boxes can be tracked via *CONTAINS_ASSET()* filter.
